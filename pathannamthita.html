    <h3>
Gavi
    </h3>
    <p>
        Gavi Eco-Tourism , a project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, has caught the attention of tourists for a while now. The project is exclusive in many respects and the majority who visited were nature lovers and adventure tourists. Over a short period of time visitors to Gavi gradually increased, especially after 'Alistair International' the world acclaimed tourism major listed it among the leading eco-tourism centres and one of the must-see places in India.

        A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.
        
        The road leading to Gavi is blanketed by tea plantations, which itself is a refreshing experience. En route to Gavi are places of interest like Mundakayyam, Kuttikanam, Peermedu and Vandiperiyar from where the road deviates to Gavi.
        
        Once you reach Gavi the serene eco-lodge 'Green Mansion' awaits you like a mother to embrace you in its protective fold. From the 'Green Mansion', one can savour the spectacular view of the Gavi Lake and the adjoining forests. Besides the accommodation provided in 'Green Mansion' visitors can also try out the tree houses here and can even pitch tents in the wilderness. Here one can have outstanding trekking experiences, which are overseen by trained local people. Those who would love to be left alone can do so in the tranquil environs of Gavi or may even go canoeing in the placid waters of the lake or enjoy a breathtaking sunset. Visitors are usually provided vegetarian food and snacks, which further adds to the eco-friendly ambience of the place.
        
        The place is rich in flora and fauna. There are hills and valleys, tropical forests, sprawling grasslands, sholas, cascading waterfalls and cardamom plantations. Endangered species including the Nilgiri Tahr and Lion-Tailed Macaque are often sighted at the outskirts of Gavi. With more than 260 species of birds including the Great Pied Hornbill, Woodpecker and Kingfishers, Gavi is literally a paradise for birdwatchers.
        
        Some of the breathtaking viewpoints at Gavi like the Valley View offer a spectacular view of the deep ravine and forest below. From Kochu Pampa, a point near Green Mansion eco-lodge, one can track the grazing Nilgiri Tahrs.
        
        The famous pilgrim destination, Sabarimala is a short trek from Gavi. For those interested in observing nocturnal wildlife, night safaris to Kullur, Gavi Pullumedu, Kochu Pampa and Pachakanam provide ample opportunities for wildlife viewing.

Konni Forest Reserve
    </h3>
    <p>
        Konni, famous for the elephant training happening in the state attracts a huge number of visitors every year. People visit here to see the biggest animal on land in close quarters without fear. One of the major attractions at Konni is the giant wooden cages or the elephant kraals used to house the elephants. Locally known as Aanakoodu, they can house up to 3 to 4 elephants at a time. With a 5-km stretch broadened by the Kallar River, Adavi welcomes you to experience nature at its best.  The package is available in two slots â€“ one is short ride and the other long ride. The place is best during monsoon as the river is full and you can experience the fresh air, and soak yourself in the scenery of pristine greenery, and clear waters of the Kallar River.

    <h3>
Pandalam Palace
    </h3>
    <p>
        Sree Ayyappa, the beloved presiding deity of the renowned Sabarimala Temple, was brought up in Pandalam as the adopted son of the Raja of Pandalam. The holy town of Pandalam, located near Chengannur in Pathanamthitta district, is perhaps second only to Sabarimala. It is the norm for pilgrims on the way to Sabarimala to offer prayers at the Valiyakoikal Temple on the banks of Achenkovil River, which has been modelled on the Sabarimala shrine. Three days prior to the legendary Makaravilaku Festival, the sacred ornaments of Sree Ayyappa are taken in a procession from Pandalam to Sabarimala.

    Triveni Sangamam
        </h3>
        <p>
            Triveni Sangamam lies on the way to Sabrimala. The devotees on their way to the famous Ayappa Temple at Sabrimala halt here to take a dip in it for redemption. Hence, it can be termed as the main halting place while visiting Sabrimala. Triveni Sangamam means the meeting point of three rivers. This is the location where the Holy Pamba river confluences with the Manimala river basin in its north and the Achankovil river basin in the south. The Pamba river is called the Dakshina Ganga or the Ganges of South India. Triveni Sangamam is visited by millions of devotees on their way to Sabrimala. This pilgrimage spot draws visitors too who come here to enjoy the beautiful landscape of the place.
